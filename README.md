# Server part of a portfolio site for a photographer
The server is deployed on the website https://photograph-portfolio-service.onrender.com.
It is written using Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB. I wrote routers, models and controllers for my API.

To run the backend I need to run the "npm install" and "npm start" commands.
